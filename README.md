# Neural Network for Binary Classification

This Python script demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a feed-forward neural network (also known as a multi-layer perceptron) for binary classification problems using the Keras API of TensorFlow. The script is designed to work with a dataset provided as a pandas DataFrame, with a binary target column named 'target'.

# Dependencies
To run this script, you will need the following Python libraries:
- tensorflow: For building and training the neural network.
- sklearn: For data preprocessing and partitioning the dataset.
- numpy: For numerical computations.
- pandas: For data manipulation.

You can install these libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Setting Up
The script assumes that you're working with a pandas DataFrame 'df' with a binary target column named 'target'. 
You'll need to replace 'df' with your actual DataFrame. Also, you'll need to adjust the number of nodes in the layers and the dropout rate based on your specific task and dataset. 
The number of input features should match the number of columns in your DataFrame (minus the target column).

# How the Script Works
The script works as follows:

1. Data Preprocessing: The script first splits the dataset into a training set and a test set. It then standardizes the features to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1, which is a common preprocessing step for neural networks.

2. Model Building: The script builds a neural network model with two hidden layers of 64 and 32 nodes respectively. It uses the 'relu' activation function and applies L2 regularization and dropout to help prevent overfitting.

3. Model Compilation: The model is compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and the 'binary_crossentropy' loss function, which is suitable for binary classification tasks.

4. Model Training: The script trains the model on the training data for a specified number of epochs, using a portion of the training data for validation. It also implements early stopping, model checkpointing, and learning rate reduction on plateau.

5. Model Evaluation: After training, the script evaluates the model's performance on the test data.

6. Model Prediction: The script uses the trained model to predict the class of a new, unseen sample.

7. Cross-Validation: The script performs K-fold cross-validation on the training data to give a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

# Possible Implementations
This script can be used as a starting point for any binary classification task. Examples include but are not limited to:

- Predicting whether a customer will churn or not
- Diagnosing a disease based on symptoms
- Determining whether a transaction is fraudulent or not

By customizing the architecture of the neural network and the parameters used during training, you can adapt this script to a wide range of datasets and tasks.

# Future Work
Recommendations for Improvement:
- Data Preprocessing: Include steps for data preprocessing like normalization, handling missing values, and feature selection.
- Code Documentation: Include detailed comments and docstrings to make the code self-explanatory.
- Error Handling: Implement checks to validate the input data and the target labels, especially to confirm that it's a binary classification problem.
- Modularity: Break down the code into smaller, reusable functions for better readability and maintainability.
- Validation Metrics: Include metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, which are crucial for evaluating binary classification models.

# Notes
- All binary classification uses supervised learning.
- Supervised learning depends on labeled data.
